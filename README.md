   ## Installation
   tech needed for this task was inquirer and fs. Once those files were obtained next step was creating the code for gathering information from a user to successfully input the description, installation, licenses, who to credit and many other questions to help create a really great looking readme file.
   ## Usage
   This generator is used mainly for people who want to describe more about the app they are creating to help direct the user (you reading this) to have the best experience using the app as possible.
 
   ## Credits 
   I couldnt take all the credit on this, I really got a big help from Trayce and Patrick. They helped me with the end of this code I was able to write a new file but getting the badge system to work was a tough one. Thanks again you two for helping me out!
 
   ## Questions 
  Well if you have any other questions that you wish to ask send them my way I will be glad to help answer any questions I can.
